/**
   A key idea introduced here is that of "task". By task I mean a
   type of a computation that Libint performs. For example, computing ERIs is
   one task, computing sets of integrals needed for the R12 theory is another
   task. The reason for speaking of separate tasks is that the evaluator type
   must be specific to the task or tasks for which it was generated. For
   example, all the intermediates needed in R12 computation are not necessary
   when computing ERIs. If one evaluator type were to cover all tasks, it would
   be huge and performance would be likely hurt. Thus we need to produce
   task-specific evaluator and associated functions (constructor, destructor,
   memory query).
